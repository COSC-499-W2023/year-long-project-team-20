## Test report
No test reports for this week

## Context
### The last features that we are hoping to have completed by the first Milestone are related to storing video, and displaying that video. For the first several weeks of the project reseach, time and effort was put into implementing AWS video. This seemed like the clear choice for an AWS service to provide the features we wanted to do. However when trying to configure AWS video with AWS amplify we came to the realization that these services were not compatible and AWS video is a deprecated service. 
This has had the following outcomes:
1. A learning experience: include in the reseach, not only what the service provides, but also the implementation in the current project.  
2. Time: The time spent researching AWS video will not provide clear parallels to our replacement AWS Kinesis Video Streams (KVS)
3. Milestone 1: The time loss will likely prevent the team from having functional video for milestone 1.
