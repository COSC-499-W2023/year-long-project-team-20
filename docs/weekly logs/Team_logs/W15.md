## Test report
No test reports for this week

## Context
This week we discussed what features we would ideally like to include in our MVP and who will do what for the peer testing milestone. Next week we plan to continue working on our assigned tasks. We also plan to have a more thorough discussion about our MVP/Client Feedback as this week we were only able to have a brief meeting about it.
