## Test report
No test reports for this week

## Context
This week the issue of s3 access denied error was finally resolved. 
This allowed the team to demonstrate key features such as being able to upload videos using our website to an s3 bucket, being able to record videos and saving the recorded video to an s3 bucket.

The team spent a considerable amount of time discussing and working on the design milestone document. Tasks for the design milestone were divided equally. Everyone contributed equally to the discussion of what to include as design changes/choices for the design milestone.
