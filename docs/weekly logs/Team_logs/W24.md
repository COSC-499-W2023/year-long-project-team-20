## Context
This week we fixed a bug that was found in the blur video backend. Previously videos recorded from our website would not be blurred though other videos would. 
We discovered this was due to the way the video was encoded, this was something that could only be changed by reprocessing the video. Ryan found a way to
do this with FFmpeg and AWS. Now if you record a video on our website with a face visible, you can see a preview of the blurred version of the video in your library. 
We just have to connect the backend to the front end to display the blurred video only upon user request.

We also have to connect the database to the front end of
our manage requests UI which has been implemented this week (sending requests to other users/viewing requests recieved). The last thing that needs to be added to the requests 
page is the UI to display what requests a user sent, which Maya will work on.

Recently we discovered a bug in the library page which seems to be fetching videos on repeat, we hope to have this fixed next week. Additionally the library needs some 
code clean up/refactorization which Issa will work on.
