## Context
After this weeks peer testing, we all had some small issues that were presented to us. These issues were mostly UI related. These changes include: Adding a link to home page from icon, Nav bar update for adding a new page for managing video requests. Other changes include: Stoping camera when not recording, showing progress bar only when uploading, and updating element positions. We expect to see more peer feedback from the Team formation page.
