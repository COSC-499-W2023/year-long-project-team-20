### Test report showing all tests have passed
## Context

Last week the delete video feature frontend and backend was completed and was manually tested by multiple members on the team. 
We also have blur video working on the back end, but have to connect it to the front end.
We discovered a couple bugs with the share video via email approach, which we will work on fixing next week.
We are also going to be working on allowing a user to see videos shared with them, within the site itself.
If we can get both working, then the user will have two ways to access videos shared with them.
Aside from that we are continuing to make improvements to the user interface based on peer feedback.
