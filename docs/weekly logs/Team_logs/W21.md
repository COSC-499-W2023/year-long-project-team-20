## Context
Sharing video and blur videos are our two MVP features remaining. Our priority is to focus all our effort on getting these features completed so that we meet our MVP as soon as possible. Mo and Abhijit are working on two separate versions of share video; Ryan has been tasked with connecting the blur feature backend to front end (No update from Ryan since February 4th). Issa and Maya are working to improve UI as a whole along with additional tasks that may arise with implementation of share video features such as develop UI interface and writing tests. 
Mo has implemented the blur video feature and was fully function we then discovered that the remote backend environment has been overwritten and the feature isn't working anymore, the feature has been tested by issa prior to the changes to AWS.
