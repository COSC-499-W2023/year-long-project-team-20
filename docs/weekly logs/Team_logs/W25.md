## Recap of Last Weeks goals

- Connect blur video back end to front end
- Request Production Access and send email to any address
- Optimize the database for easier lookup

## Goals for next week

- Fix memory crash bug
- Ability to view blur videos on a separate window/page.
- CSS styling as finishing touch for website.
- Search feature on library page

## Context

This week, we accomplished the task of managing our requests feature. Requests can be sent to a user notifying that they would like to receive a video. The front end and back end aspect of this feature is running smoothly. We will also implement an email notification to be sent to a user notifying them that they have received a request.
Other general UI features were implemented such as remembering the state of which window was active in the library and requests feature page with the help of context API
We are still missing the part of being able to view blurred videos on a separate window/page and we hope to get it done by next week.
Currently, we our app is crashing due to a memory issue identified last week. This has still not been fixed. Hopefully, we are able to identify the solution to fix this issue.
Overall, all our MVP features + the additional feature requested by client as part of design milestone feedback has been completed.
