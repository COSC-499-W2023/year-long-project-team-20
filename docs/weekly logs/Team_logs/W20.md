## Context
Sharing video and blur videos are our two MVP features remaining. Our priority is to focus all our effort on getting these features completed so that we meet our MVP as soon as possible. Mo and Abhijit are working on two separate versions of share video; Ryan has been tasked with connecting the blur feature backend to front end (No update from Ryan since February 4th). Issa and Maya are working to improve UI as a whole along with additional tasks that may arise with implementation of share video features such as develop UI interface and writing tests. 
This week we continued to face problems with AWS backend not recognizing the user pool. At first we assumed that this issue was a fault of our own; but, as we kept investigating we found that this is a know bug/issue with AWS amplify and found similar issues in the AWS amplify repository. See https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-studio/issues/730. So we tried a lot of different suggestions we found on stackoverflow/github; but utimately when we disabled our amplify studio, renabled it, and changed our build settings our user pool started to get recognized again.
