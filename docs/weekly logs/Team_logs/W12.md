## Test report
No test reports for this week

## Context
Issa is still working on how to integrate the front-end to the backend resources, meanwhile Mo and Abijith are working on integrating the database with the front-end of the app. Ryan is working on how to implement rekognition to process the videos. Maya is working of the front-end design and implementation. 

This week we altered our backend approach to uploading videos, it was a tough decision to make because it had an impact on other key features we had planned. We spent time analyzing the pros and cons of making the decision, everyone participated in these conversations. We also spent time trying to familiarize ourselves with the new approach we planned on taking.
