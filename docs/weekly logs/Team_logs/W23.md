## Context

We made a lot of changes to the UI based on the feedback we received from fellow students. The updated UI creates better navigation and user experience. 
After this weeks peer testing, we all had some small issues that were presented to us. These issues were mostly UI related. These changes include: Adding a link to home page from icon, Nav bar update for adding a new page for managing video requests. Other changes include: Stoping camera when not recording, showing progress bar only when uploading, and updating element positions. We expect to see more peer feedback from the Team formation page.
