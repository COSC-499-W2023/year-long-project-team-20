 ![img](https://i.imgur.com/qdTYmFy.png)

 ### Tasks Completed this week
 * Worked on the blur video feature but the rest was allocated to Ryan
 * Worked on the UI and how our website looked.

 ### Goals for next week
 * Most of our feedback was related to UI, so I will be working on improving that in our project
 * Attempt a request video feature (not included in MVC)

 ### Context
 I started this week with fixing the send video feature I built last week but it broke because of an Amplify issue, I then started working on blur video since Ryan hasn't made progress in this feature for a long time. I talked to Ryan and he said he will complete the feature on his own so I left it to him.

 Most of our feedback was regarding the UI of our website, So I want to simplify and make the navigation more intuitive, I am also adding minor UI features like better looking forms, alerts when things happen in the website that are in theme.

 ## Week 10 (Mar 12 - Mar 17)
 ![img](https://i.imgur.com/UfRwi1e.png)

 ### Tasks complete this week
 * I built a sophisticated UI for the Library page, including modals, interactive buttons and video cards, I had to restructure our code to achieve that and make it more readable and understandable
 * I build a lambda function that will handle search inquiries to use in building a search bar that will help user's find the user they want to send a video to

 ### Goals for next week
 * Discuss with the team on any UI improvement we can incorporate and build it.
 * Finish building the search bar 
 * transfer some methods from the client side to the server side (lambda functions) to make the app more secure

 ### Context 
 I started the week with building significant improvements on the UI for the library page, I made it more interactive and intuitive. This indluded building a modal for sending videos insetead of having a form under each video. I then seperated "uploaded videos" and "Received videos" using an interactive button that switches the DOM between the two lists, I also build video cards for the videos that look better and are easier to manipulate within the code. 
 I also started building a search bar which will make sending the video to the right user easier, I built the lambda function for this feature and made progress on the frontend of the search bar. The feature isn't functional yet.

 ## Week 11 (Mar 17 - Mar 25)
 ![img](https://i.imgur.com/ejxi1qo.png)
 ### Tasks complete this week
 * made progress in implementing search 
 * working with ryan to complete the video blur feature's front end
 ### Goals for next week
 * Discuss with the team on any UI improvement we can incorporate and build it.
 * transfer some methods from the client side to the server side (lambda functions) to make the app more secure

 ### Context 
 I was tasked with building the UI for blur video feature and now waiting for Ryan to finish building the backend to implement the design, I am also working on transferring some of the features that are implemented on the client side to be run on AWS instead using lambda function, that will make the app more secure.
