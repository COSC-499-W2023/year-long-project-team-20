 ![img](https://i.imgur.com/qdTYmFy.png)

 ### Tasks Completed this week
 * Worked on the blur video feature but the rest was allocated to Ryan
 * Worked on the UI and how our website looked.

 ### Goals for next week
 * Most of our feedback was related to UI, so I will be working on improving that in our project
 * Attempt a request video feature (not included in MVC)

 ### Context
 I started this week with fixing the send video feature I built last week but it broke because of an Amplify issue, I then started working on blur video since Ryan hasn't made progress in this feature for a long time. I talked to Ryan and he said he will complete the feature on his own so I left it to him.

 Most of our feedback was regarding the UI of our website, So I want to simplify and make the navigation more intuitive, I am also adding minor UI features like better looking forms, alerts when things happen in the website that are in theme.
