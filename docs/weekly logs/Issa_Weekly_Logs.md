## Week 10 (Work Period Nov 6th - Nov 12th) 

### Tasks Completed This Week
* Team meetings
* Currently learning WebRTC courses on udemy as this a topic that requires a lot of knowledge. A significant progress was not made due to workload from other courses and due to the high learning curve associated with the topic.
* Planning to use reading break/upcoming weeks to make more progress




### Goals for Next Week (after reading break)
* My goals for the next week remains the same as last week which is to make progress on AWS kinesis with WebRTC.
* We assigned three people to learn AWS Kinesis with WebRTC so we will work together and pool our knowledge to make progress.

## Week 12 (Work Period Nov 20th - Nov 26th)
* Team meetings
* Code review(Mo and Maya's front end code)
* Learning about Kinesis video streams(KVS) and webRTC. Unfortunately, this topic is significantly more overwhelming and difficult than anticipated and beyond my technical skill/knowledge. I spent a great deal of time reading documentation for the first half of the week. I looked for guides/documentation to help get started but none of the guides go past the basic concepts/steps. I finally found a workshop tutorial for KVS streams/webRTC on Saturday and spent 4-5 hours on Sunday trying to follow the tutorial. I was not able to get past a certain step due to a error when creating a cloudstack. This is usually the case when following AWS guides. Also even if I had made it past that step I we would not be able to figure out how to integrate the knowledge from the tutorial with our project in time for the milestone. Tutorial progress is entirely on AWS console and not on github.
* We assigned 3 people (Abijit, Ryan, and I) to learn AWS Kinesis with WebRTC so we could work together and pool our knowledge to make progress; however, this didn't work out as none of us were able to make progress.

### Goals for Next Week
* Implement front end functionality of deleting uploaded video
* Implement back end functionaly of deleting uploaded video
* Documentation for design milestone

### Recap goals
* My goals for the next week remains the same as last week which is to make progress on AWS kinesis with WebRTC.
* We assigned three people to learn AWS Kinesis with WebRTC so we will work together and pool our knowledge to make progress.

## Week 13 (Work Period Nov 27th - Dec 3rd, 2023)
* Team meetings 
* My initial goal for this week was to implement the delete video front end/ui component and the backend functionality for it. However, that did not seem feasible due to my limited knowledge on how to code front end and the fact that Mo/Abhijit were not able to figure out how to upload videos to the S3 bucket due to the permission denied error.
* So I decided to look into the permission denied error myself. My initial thoughts on the error was that it could be a matter of requiring some schema or GraphQl functionality to interact with the S3 bucket. So I decided to start tackling this error by setting out to learn GraphQL and trying to follow some online tutorials so that we could be sure that the error is not related to our AWS accounts.
* (Friday)I spent 2-3 hours watching videos on GraphQL and how to use GraphQL to interact with a database. I dont quite understand if we will ever need to use GraphQL or not but it was good to get a start on learning GraphQL. I tried to create some schemas and queries on the AppSync dashboard but I didn't quite grasp how it all works together. This topic will take a lot more time for me to understand and learn properly. 
* (Saturday) I decided to then look for tutorials that showed how to work with s3 buckets without GraphQl.
* (Saturday) I spent 2-3 hours trying to work through this photo sharing workshop https://github.com/dabit3/amplify-photo-sharing-workshop. Reason being that if we can figure out how to upload images then we should be able to figure out how to upload videos. I created a branch issa-photoTutorial to follow along with the photo sharing workshop. However, I was not successful in implementing the photo sharing workshop due to some deprecated instructions being used. I tried to update the code but eventually decided to look for a newer tutorial. 
* (Saturday) Spent 1-2 hours working with this tutorial that I found in this blog https://welearncode.com/get-started-s3/. I created a fresh public repo on my own account to follow the tutorial: https://github.com/xIssa11/musicShare. I then deployed the front end and back end for this repo on amplify by creating a new app called music share which can be accessed by this link: https://main.d1zwgz6w18v6dp.amplifyapp.com/. I was successfully able to create a s3 bucket and use my musicshare app to upload mp3 files to the s3 bucket from the front end functionality of the app. 
* (Saturday) I shared my progress with the group on discord and Maya was excited to hear about the progress and wanted to get on a call to discuss. Maya and I thought that the access denied error was happening as a result of the bucket being initially created with improper access privileges. So we decided to delete our current s3 buckets and create a new bucket as we dont know how to edit the access privileges of a bucket after its already been created. With the newly created bucket we were able make the upload video functionality work for 1 video. Abhijit joined the discord call at this point. The upload video functionality bugged out as he joined the call and we were not able to upload any more videos due to the access denied error. This was a really strange error as it did upload one video. After spending a bit of time trouble shooting we decided to clean up all our s3 buckets and try creating a fresh s3 bucket and retracing our steps agian. This time the upload video functionality worked for multiple videos and did not bug out. We pushed our changes to the uploadVideo branch and merged it to main. Overall, this took around 2 hours. 
* (Sunday) 1 hour team meeting discussing desgin milestone and dividing up tasks
* (Sunday) 5 hours spent on design milestone. Created navigation flow of website and highlighted UI design choices. Helped others with their tasks such providing feedback on architecture design, overview content of design video etc.
* (Sunday) Completed Team Log for the week.

## Week 3 (Work Period Jan 22nd - Jan 28th, 2023)

### Tasks completed this week

* Team meetings
* Figured out how to run tests automatically through amplify. Wrote the test section in the yml artifact build file. Now every github branch prior to merge to master can be connected to amplify. This allows the branch to run all our cypress tests and show the results. 
* While I did write the test section of the yml artifact build file. There was an error with syntax formatting which caused it to not work. Abijit corrected this issue
* Learnt a bit of figma
* Used amplify studio along with figma to edit our nav bar to have a upload and library section. Context: This will allow our website to have a page specifically for uploading vidoes as opposed to our previous approach in which a user had to click the record button in the nav bar to see the option to upload video from file system. The library button (currently not functional) in the nav bar will direct users to the page where users can see all vidoes they have uploaded as well as videos shared with them from other users.
* Wrote code to make the upload button in the nav bar functional. 

### Goals for Next Week
* Implement font end ui for delete video feature
* Implement back end for delete video feature

### Recap goals
* Spend time learning how to code front end to create button for delete video feature
* Spend time learning how to interact with s3 buckets to implement delete video feature.
