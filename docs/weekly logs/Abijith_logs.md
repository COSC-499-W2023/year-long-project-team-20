# Abijith Ashok Log

## Week 10 (November 6th to November 12th)
## Features Worked on
- Tried using the amplify video package to initialize the backend environment with amplify studio
- - Amplify push/Buiding resources failed ( error logs are attached in the docs folder) 
- - cannot figure out how to make it work with the current tech stack
- - will have to rebuild after researching about new backend tech stack
- - all work done with this approach can be seen on the branch (ullattil-video-trial)

- Building in progress with cloudformation for video service
- - it shows create complete, but untested as of the time of writing
- - will test setting up S3 bucket to pull video for each user
- - still shows create in progress (after running it for 2 hours). I will update log once the build is complete

## Goals for next week
- Finish building the backend resources for creating and uploading video for each user
- Test the new build by uploading and downloading video for each user
