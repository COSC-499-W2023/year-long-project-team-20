### Tasks Completed This Week 
* Worked with team to discuss what we will each say for the presentation
* Decided with team to pivot away from using amplify video due to its limited documentation and it no longer being maintained/upkept
* Decided with team to switch video back end to AWS Kinesis, as it was suggested by the client
* Had my git branch connected to amplify (as did the rest of the team so now we have the ability to work separately for the front end)

### Tasks in Progress 
* Research how Amazon kinesis can be integrated/implemented with our current project
* Complete presentation

### Context for week 7
* In the process of trying to implement aws video, our website deployment began failing on amplify. With the help of another team member this issue was resolved, but set us back in terms of making progress


## Week 7 - Project Log
**Work period October 16th - October 22nd**

### Tasks Completed This Week 
* Connect amplify to my local repository
* Run website locally
* Research how to set up amplify to work with multiple collaborators
  
### Tasks in Progress 
* Set up video back end
* Possibly modify amplify environment set up so that multiple people can work on it simultaneously, pending discussion with team members 


### Context for week 7
This week the team members in charge of setting up Amplify were able to complete this task which was demonstrated to the rest of the team on Tuesday. I began the set up process of connecting my local environment with our set up amplify environment to be able to run it and modify it. By thursday I was able to run the website locally but was having problems connecting it with amplify. I helped other team members with running the website locally. 

Thursday we shifted the allocation of tasks. To set up Amplify we switched our front end from Next/ts to react. Due to this my record video front-end task was set aside for a later time. One member was having trouble with signing into aws/completing the amplify set up, so I was assigned to work on the video back end set up. For the rest of the week this is what I worked on. First I had to complete connecting my environment with the existing amplify backend, which I was able to do. 

I tried to configure amplify so that I could test out the video back end feature on a seperate amplify environment (equivalent to a git branch) so that in case something went wrong it wouldn't impact the website we currently had running. However I had troubles with this, my environment would give me errors upon deploying the website using my git branch. I decided to just try and set up the video back end on the main environment running it locally, without pushing to amplify.

### Tasks Completed This Week 
**Work period October 12th - October 15th**
* Researched TypeScript basics online 
* Started experimenting with the sample Node.js/TypeScript project, implemented basic designs for the welcome page 
* Attended amplify set up meeting with team members 
  
### Tasks in Progress
* Begin working on record video back end now that amplify is set up 
* Continue working on front end (record video page)


## Week 5 - Project 

### Tasks Completed This Week
* Created basic UI designs in figma for the record video view 
* Disscused design ideas for the user home page and how shared videos will be accessed
* Reviewed how AWS/Amplify works with team members 
* Conducted research on how backend implementation of recording a video will work
  
### Next Week Goals
* Expand upon figma prototype design in collaboration with other team members (edit video view, add contact view, profile view, login view, sign up view, welcome page view)
  * Refine the record video view
* After prototype is complete, modify tasks assigned if new features are added or removed
* Help team members working on the aws/amplify set up
  * If set up goes well, then begin working on the record video front end. Other wise, just focus on helping members with the set up
