## Week 3
## Overview of tasks:
### After being assigned to the datastructure portion of the word chain assignment I broke up the requirements into the following:
1. Find a word bank that would fit our specifications.
After reviewing many sources (most of which were in a unusable data format) I came upon 12Dicts and the various compliations of dictionaries. I chose the 2of12 wordlist which has all the words that were in at least 2 of the 12 major dictionaries. Resulting in a 41000 word .txt file.
2. Then with the .txt file I had to write code in python to convert to a .csv file. 
3. Take the .csv file and seperate it into seperate .csv files where the lengths of words were the same.
4. Write a simple python function to grab the designated .csv file convert it to a list and pass that to whoever needs it for the algorithm.
5. Finally I needed to document my work and push the python file and .csvs to the repo.
